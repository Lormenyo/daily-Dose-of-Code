# A student is taking a cryptography class and has found anagrams to be very useful. 
# Two strings are anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to 
# form the second string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the 
# same exact frequency. For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.

# The student decides on an encryption scheme that involves two large strings. The encryption is 
# dependent on the minimum number of character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. 
# Determine this number.

# Given two strings,  and , that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of 
# character deletions required to make  and  anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.

# Example
# a = 'cde'
#  b = 'dcf'

# Delete e from a and f from b so that the remaining strings are cd and dc which are anagrams. 
# This takes 2 character deletions.


#only works for 2 test cases
def makeAnagram1(a, b):
    diff = (len(a) - len(set(a))) + (len(b)-len(set(b)))
    return len(set(a) ^ set(b)) + diff

def makeAnagram2(a,b):
    a = sorted(list(a))
    b = sorted(list(b))

    return sum(aElement != bElement for aElement, bElement in zip(a, b) ) + abs(len(a)-len(b))
